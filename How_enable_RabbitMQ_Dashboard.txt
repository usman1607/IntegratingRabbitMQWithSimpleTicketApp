Enabling RabbitMQ Management Plugin – Dashboard
Now that we have our RabbitMQ Service installed at the sysyem level, we need to activate the Management Dashboard which by default is disabled. To do this, open up Command Prompt with Admin Rights and enter the following command

cd C:\Program Files\RabbitMQServer\rabbitmq_server-3.10.6\sbin
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
net stop RabbitMQ
net start RabbitMQ

Line #1 we make the instalation directory as our default working directory for cmd. Please note that your directory path may differ.
Line #2 – Here we enable the Management Plugin
Line #3-4 – We restart the RabbitMQ Service.
